🌱 Branch Information

| **`develop`** | 🌱 **Experimental Development Branch** — Used for testing and adding new features. Code here may be unstable. |
| **`refactor/correct-version`** | 🔧 **Refactored & Corrected Version** — Contains the latest fixes, improvements, and architectural refinements. |
| **`main`** | 🧩 **Stable Release Branch** — Production-ready and runnable version of the CLI. Merges from `refactor/correct-version` after validation. |
